# Final-Lab-Task-3
- This portfolio shows how I learned MySQL by making and managing a product database. It includes easy steps like creating a table, setting rules, adding proper data, and editing a field. The main goal is to understand how to build and arrange a database using simple SQL commands.

# Step by Step Process:
## 1. Create the Table 
* Create a table named products with the following fields:
* id - an auto incrmenting primary key
* product_name - a text field with a maximum of 100 characters that cannot be null
* price - a decimal field

## 2. applying a CHECK constraint
* implement a CHECK constraint to ensure that the price field always contains a value greater than 0.

## 3. Insert products
* Insert only the products with a positive price into the products table.
* Exclude any items with negative prices.

* Here are the valid entries to insert:
  *  Laptop - 999.99
  *  Smartphone - 599.99
  *  Tablet -  299.99
  *  Keyboard - 19.99
  *  Mouse - 14.99
  *  Desk Lamp - 24.99
  *  Speakers - 9.99
 
## 4. Update the Table
* Update the product_name field so that it can store up to 120 characters.
